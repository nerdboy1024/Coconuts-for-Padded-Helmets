# Coconuts-for-Padded-Helmets
Coconuts for Padded Helmets is a Discord bot aimed at playfully handling users who ask questions just to get attention. If you're tired of people fishing for replies with the same repetitive questions, this bot will respond with a humorous twist, making sure everyone has a laugh (except maybe the person in the padded helmet ðŸ¥³).
