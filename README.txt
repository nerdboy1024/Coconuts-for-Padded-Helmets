# 🥥 Coconuts for Padded Helmets 🥥

**Coconuts for Padded Helmets** is a Discord bot aimed at playfully handling users who ask questions just to get attention. 
If you're tired of people fishing for replies with the same repetitive questions, this bot will respond with a humorous twist, 
making sure everyone has a laugh (except maybe the person in the padded helmet 🥳).

## Features

- 🚨 **Detects Attention-Seeking Questions**: Automatically spots common repetitive phrases and responses.
- 🤖 **Sassy Replies**: Provides a playful, sometimes snarky response to keep the conversation fun.
- 📝 **Tracking System**: Optionally tracks the frequency of these questions for extra trolling.
- 🎭 **Customizable Responses**: Tailor the replies to fit the vibe of your Discord server.
- 🧑‍💬 **Special User Replies**: Automatically replies to a designated user (a.k.a. Coconuts) every time they send a message, just to keep things lively.

## Technologies

- **Discord.py**: Because Python is the only language Coconuts can sit still long enough to learn. Plus, it’s beginner-friendly and Coconuts-proof (well, mostly).
- **Firebase**: We needed a database that could survive the storm of Coconuts antics. Firebase has the scalability to handle Coconuts repetitive testing without crashing.
- **Railway.app**: Hosting on Railway gives us the best chance of surviving Coconuts inevitable spam sessions. It scales automatically, so we don’t have to worry about Coconuts crashing the bot... too easily.
